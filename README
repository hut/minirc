minirc - minimalistic rc script
===============================

The script "rc" is a minimalistic init script made for use with busybox init.
It starts up udev, sets the hostname, mounts the file systems, starts the
daemons and so on.

Later, in the user space, you can use it to list currently running daemons and
individually start or stop them.

It was developed for arch linux to get rid of systemd, but it can probably run
on other distributions as well.


A word of warning
-----------------

This works on my machine^TM.  You absolutely need to read and understand what
it does before using it.  Compare it to your existing init script and see if
there is something you need to add (for example, setting time zone, mounting
encrypted non-root file systems and many other things are simply not handled.)

Also, get a rescue system ready because things will break if you don't know
what you're doing.


Installing
----------

Dependencies: busybox, optionally systemd (for udev)

NOTE: The archlinux AUR package does step 1 for you.

1. There is a setup.sh script, but you should read it first.  If you don't use
a package manager which does the sanity checks for you, please check for
yourself that it doesn't break your system by overwriting essential files.
Make backups as needed.

When you are confident, run "./setup.sh --force"

2. Add init=/sbin/init to your kernel parameters.  Alternatively, since
/sbin/init is the default, you can just remove it or leave it empty.  Check the
docs of your boot loader on how to change the kernel parameters.

3. Configure /sbin/rc and /etc/minirc.conf according to your likings.
See sections "Dealing with services" and "Further configuration".

4. Reboot


Shutdown & Reboot
-----------------

You need to use busybox's version of the reboot command by either typing in
"busybox reboot" or by linking busybox to /bin/reboot and executing it.
The same goes for "halt" and "poweroff".

You can alternatively send the signals TERM for reboot, USR1 for halt or USR2
for poweroff to the process 1.


Dealing with services
---------------------

The variable ALL_DAEMONS contains a space-separated list of services that
minirc lists when you ask which services currently run.

The variable DEFAULT_DAEMONS contains a space-separated list of services that
are started on boot.

By default, the two are identical.  You can override them in /etc/minirc.conf.
It is simply sourced by the script right after defining the default variables.

To add another service, simply add it to the respective variable.  If you don't
specify anything else -- and this is indeed enough for most services -- minirc
has certain standard behaviours for starting, stopping and polling a service
with the name $service:

1. rc start $service          -> execute "$service"
2. rc stop $service           -> execute "killall $service"
3. determine if $service runs -> execute "pgrep $service"

For some services, such as iptables, this obviously doesn't work.  For those,
there are individual entries in the functions "start_process", "stop_process"
and "poll_process".


Further configuration
---------------------

1. udev

You need to decide what to use to set up the devices and load the modules.
minirc supports busybox's mdev and systemd's udev by default.  You can change
the udev system by writing UDEV=systemd or UDEV=busybox respectively into
/etc/minirc.conf.

systemd's udev works out of the box, so it's recommended.  To set up mdev, you
can use this as a reference: https://github.com/slashbeast/mdev-like-a-boss


Usage of the user space program
-------------------------------

Run "rc --help" for information.  Never run "rc init" except during the boot
process, when called by busybox init.
